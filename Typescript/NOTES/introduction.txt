  It is also a compiler that you run over your code to compile TypeScript code
  to JavaScript. TypeScript adds Types to allow me to identify errors quicker before

TypeScript adds:

  o Non-JavaScript features like Interfaces or Generics
  o Meta-Programming features like Decorators
  o Rich configurable options - e.g. ability to configure the compiler
